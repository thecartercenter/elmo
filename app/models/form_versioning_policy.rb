# Implements the policy about when a form's version should be upgraded.
# Any form component objects (Option, OptionSet, Optioning, Question, Questioning) should call this class before updating.
# This class tells them which, if any, forms will require a version update as a result.
# If the update proceeds, this class should be notified again, whereupon it will tell the appropriate Forms to upgrade their versions.
