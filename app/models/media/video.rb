    # A note on validation:
    # We no longer validate file extensions because we can't anticipate what extensions folks
    # will be sending from ODK Collect (since the platform changes over time)
    # and there is no easy way to allow the user to correct behavior on validation fail-we just have to
    # discard the file. So for that we reason we limit to mime type validation only since that still
    # provides some security but is less restrictive and less superficial.
    #
    # The list of types here is those we expect to be captured by an Android phone.
