# ELMO
ELMO is a mobile data collection and analysis web application. Originally designed for the [Carter Center](http://www.cartercenter.org) for election observation missions, ELMO can be used in many different contexts for data collection.

Consider ELMO if you need:

- Integrated form design
- Standardized form sets
- Multiple data entry paths, including web, ODK Collect, and SMS
- Multiple mission/project management
- Advanced user management with multiple permission levels
- SMS broadcasting
- Custom, real-time reporting

To learn more about the history and goals of the project, [visit the ELMO project site](http://getelmo.org).
You can also learn more about The Carter Center's Election Standards [here](http://cartercenter.org).

## How Do I Contribute to ELMO?

ELMO is 100% open-source. We would like you to be part of the ELMO community! We accept and encourage contributions from the public. You can start by filing a bug report or feature request using the 'Issues' feature on Github. Or contact [Tom Smyth](https://github.com/hooverlunch) for more info.

### ELMO Data Model

Contributors may find our auto-generated [Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)](docs/erd.pdf) useful.
You can generate it by running ```rake db:migrate ``` if adding new migrations or ```rake erd``` to run on its own. To skip running it when doing migrations run ```NO_DIAGRAM=1 rake db:migrate```
