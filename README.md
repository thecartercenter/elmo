# ELMO
ELMO is a mobile data collection and analysis web application. Originally designed for the [Carter Center](http://www.cartercenter.org) for election observation missions, ELMO can be used in many different contexts for data collection.

Consider ELMO if you need:

- Integrated form design
- Standardized form sets
- Multiple data entry paths, including web, ODK Collect, and SMS
- Multiple mission/project management
- Advanced user management with multiple permission levels
- SMS broadcasting
- Custom, real-time reporting

To learn more about the history and goals of the project, [visit the ELMO project site](http://getelmo.org).
You can also learn more about The Carter Center's Election Standards [here](http://cartercenter.org).

## How Do I Install ELMO?

In the future, we plan to offer managed instances of ELMO.

For an easy production setup, PaaS providers like [Heroku](http://heroku.com) or [Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com) would work well for ELMO.

Or to setup an instance manually for development or production use, you can follow the instructions below.

Note that manually setting up a Rails application for production use can be a complicated process, and the best practices for doing so change regularly. Your best bet is a web search for something like 'deploying rails app to ubuntu'.

### Package Managers

Note to install the software below we recommend the following package managers:

- Mac OS X: MacPorts or Homebrew
- Linux/Unix: bundled package manager (e.g. apt-get, yum)
- Windows: Npackd

### Required Software

1. **Ruby 1.9.3+**

1. **Memcached 1.4+**
  - A good resource on how to install on a Mac is [here](http://www.jroller.com/JamesGoodwill/entry/installing_and_configuring_memcached)
  - Ensure memcached is running, even for development, since caching is enabled in development and production environments.

1. **MySQL 5.0+**
  - Create an empty database and accompanying user for use by the app (E.g. development database *elmo_d* with username *elmo*)
  - Set up mysql for timezone support: See [doc here](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/time-zone-support.html)

1. **Web Server**
  - If your instance is for development only, you can use Rails' built-in web server by running `rails s`, as discussed below.
  - If your instance is for production use, you will need a production-grade web server, such as nginx or Apache, and app server, such as Passenger, Unicorn, Thin, etc.

1. **Sphinx 2.0.6+**
  - Sphinx is an open source search engine.
  - It should be available through any of the package managers listed above. If not it can be built from source.
  - The Rails Gem that talks to Sphinx is called Thinking Sphinx.
  - The [Thinking Sphinx site](http://pat.github.io/thinking-sphinx/) is a good place to go for troubleshooting and documentation.

### Running the App

1. **Retrieve project files using Git**

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/thecartercenter/elmo.git
  ```

1. **Bundle, configure, and migrate**
  - Install the required gems by running `bundle install` in the project directory.
  - Copy `config/database.yml.example` to `config/database.yml` and edit `database.yml` to point to your database.
  - Copy `config/thinking_sphinx.yml.example` to `thinking_sphinx.yml.example` and adjust any settings (usually not necessary).
  - Copy `config/initializers/local_config.rb.example` to `config/initializers/local_config.rb` and adjust any settings.
  - Run database migrations: `rake db:migrate`.
  - Create an admin account: `rake db:create_admin`.

1. **Build the Sphinx index**
  - Run `rake ts:rebuild`
  - This should also start the Sphinx daemon (searchd). If at any time it needs to be restarted, you can also run `rake ts:start`

1. **Run Whenever to setup cron jobs**
  - Run `whenever -i elmo`
  - Run `crontab -l` and verify that jobs have been added.

1. **Start the server**
  - For a development setup, just run `rails s`.
  - For a production setup, this will depend on your choice of servers, process monitors, etc., and goes beyond the scope of this document.

1. **Login**
  - Navigate to the app's URL (http://localhost:3000 by default in a development setup).
  - Login using username **admin** and password **temptemp** (make sure to change the password).
  - Create a new Mission and get started making forms!

### Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

Please use our Redmine instance at http://redmine.sassafras.coop/projects/elmo. Bugs/feature requests can be reported anonymously.

### ELMO Data Model

Contributors may find our auto-generated [Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)](docs/erd.pdf) useful.
You can generate it by running ```rake db:migrate ``` if adding new migrations or ```rake erd``` to run on its own. To skip running it when doing migrations run ```NO_DIAGRAM=1 rake db:migrate```
